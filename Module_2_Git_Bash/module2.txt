1) Git is a version control system tool that is used to manage programming and or code by tracking and recording activites. Git is different from Github, by Github being the platform on which Git can store and manage the information it records. Github displays the information it receives from Git to make a more visually interactive space for code. Also Github can be used to display the work being done to anyone. 

2) Terminal should be used because it is recognized to be more professional than a graphical user interface and considered a best practice, being correct and or the most effective method. 

3) There are many benefits to version control. One benefit is it allows users to keep history of the project that is being worked on. This is necessary for accountability, documentation and storage. A second benefit is the ability to try code and experiments by having implentations be branched off or just reverting the version to its orginal state if code is not effective. A third benefit to version control is easy accessability to discover what went wrong such as bugs and compare actions such as replicated code. This is helps manage time efficiently and have smooth flowing programming.
