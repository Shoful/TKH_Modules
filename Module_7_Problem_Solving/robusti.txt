My application is a tool where after scanning a person's body in our in-house main facility or 3rd party facilities. All types of illnesses, cancers, deficiencies are diagnosed and identified thoroughly and accurately to prevent any harm to the body in addition to improving health as well. The app will download results from scanning and will be readily accessible to users to use anytime to look at internal body images either as 2d images or 3d renderings where the user can go in-depth to look at organs and other body parts. Also, the app will have the ability to suggest best practices for their conditions such as what vitamins are needed, quick checkout access to buy needed or suggested vitamins. 
Additionally, if a user needs to do certain exercises and movements then the app will relay that information and on an alerted schedule if needed. The main thing that sets us apart from other companies and other services is that I want it to be as easily accessible as a bodega or Mcdonald's. The app's mainstay is the needed scanning of the body which is named "The Screener". The Screener goes beyond physical checkups and blood exams to penetrate what the eyes cannot see and what routine exams cannot detect. The app should also be able to book appointments to doctors through our curated and vetted assortment of doctors who are one the main appeals of the app because many doctors nowadays are not people-friendly, lack emotional intelligence, and are not up to par with contemporary treatments and overall best practices. The app wants to eliminate the fear of malpractice, arrogance, tenured but outdated practices. 
	 
The problem facing many people around the world is the lack of access to the knowledge and implementation of good health practices, as well as a lack of resources to treat sicknesses and ailments. The effects of these problems are many deaths and loss of health that could've been prevented with due care and early detection. In the health care field, there is a saying that "prevention is the best medicine" and I firmly believe that early detection of even the slightest possible harm can save people from bigger problems later. Everyone across the world is affected by a lack of health care and resources but the most vulnerable are those facing poverty. 
	 
The app is focused on fixing and or eliminating the root causes of many of society's health problems which are the high costs of treatment, lack of facilities in certain areas, overcomplications of health such as doctor visits, referrals, wait times, travel, and appointments. 
	 
The MVP or Minimal Viable Product is an app named Robust-i. The name stems from robust which is defined as strong, healthy, and vigorous. The app should download and connect the results of a full-body scan using MRI(Magnetic resonance imaging) automatically. It will allow users to be notified of any sort of outlier or discrepancy in the body and this will be done by comparing user data to an array of average healthy bodies for accurate interpretation because comparing to single data isn't accurate. The app will detect cancer, 
lack of nutrients, hormonal imbalances, lack of essential body components, and detections of ailments and sicknesses.
